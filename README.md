# **Multi-Protocol Network Simulation with VLSM, NAT & ACLs**  

## **üìå Project Description**  
This project simulates a complex enterprise-grade network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, integrating multiple routing protocols (**EIGRP, OSPF, RIP**) with route redistribution, **VLSM subnetting**, **DHCP**, **NAT**, and **ACLs** for secure traffic filtering. Designed for network engineering students and professionals, it demonstrates scalable network design, dynamic IP allocation, and controlled service access.

## **‚ú® Key Features**  
‚úÖ **Multi-Protocol Routing**:  
   - EIGRP (Blocks B & F), OSPF (Areas 1 & 2 in Blocks A & C), and RIP (Block E) with seamless redistribution.  
‚úÖ **Optimized Subnetting**:  
   - **VLSM** for efficient IP allocation across 14+ subnets (Networks A‚ÄìN).  
‚úÖ **Centralized DHCP**:  
   - Dynamic IP assignment for hosts in EIGRP, OSPF, and RIP blocks via a server in Block D.  
‚úÖ **Security & Access Control**:  
   - **NAT** on Router21 (Network K) & Router10 (Network F) for public IP translation.  
   - **ACLs** to restrict web server access (blocked: PC in Network A, laptop in E, smartphone in B, all hosts in D).  
‚úÖ **FTP Server**:  
   - Configured in Network G with upload permissions restricted to authorized hosts.
